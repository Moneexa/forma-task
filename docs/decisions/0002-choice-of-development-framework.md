## Context and Problem Statement

Choose the best framework that suits us.

## Decision Drivers

* Code Reusability
* Time Constraint
* Reactivity

* React
* Vue
* Svelte

Chosen option: "React", because Within React , we can make manageable components which are reusable for other devs. Moreover since I was well-versed with React, so it reduced time developing it. The reactivity and state management is also achievable in React.

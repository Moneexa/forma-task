# Choice of Development Framework

* Status: proposed
* Date: 2024-08-29

Technical Story: framework choice

## Context and Problem Statement

Choose the best framework that suits us.

## Decision Drivers

* Code Reusability
* Time Constraint
* Reactivity
* State Persistence

## Considered Options

* React
* Vue
* Svelte

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "React", because Within React , we can make manageable components which are reusable for other devs. Moreover since I was well-versed with React, so it reduced time developing it. The reactivity and state management is also achievable in React.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### React

* Good, because React’s component-based architecture allows for the creation of highly reusable components, enhancing consistency and efficiency.
* Good, because My  Existing expertise in React  reduces the learning curve and accelerates development.
* Good, because React’s virtual DOM ensures high performance in dynamic and interactive applications.
* Good, because Robust state management solutions like Redux and Context API facilitate efficient state persistence and management.
* Bad, because While efficient, React may not match the performance optimizations of newer frameworks like Svelte in specific scenarios.

### Vue

* Good, because Vue’s single-file components allow for a clear and maintainable structure, promoting reusability.
* Good, because Vue’s reactivity system is simple and powerful, providing a seamless development experience for dynamic interfaces.
* Good, because Vuex, Vue’s state management library, is well-integrated and powerful for handling state persistence.
* Bad, because My limited experience with Vue can slow down the development process. Hence compromising time-constraint.

### Svelte

* Good, because Svelte’s approach reduces boilerplate code, making development faster and simpler.
* Good, because Built-in reactivity makes it straightforward to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
* Bad, because While Svelte promotes simplicity, its component reusability is less proven compared to React’s well-established patterns.
* Bad, because While Svelte has state management capabilities, they are less mature and widely adopted compared to solutions in React and Vue.
